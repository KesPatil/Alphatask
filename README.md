The robustness and adaptability (evolvability of a species share a non-monotonic relation as reported by many experimentalists
and theoreticians. I will add the references to this information shortly. 

In this regard, I have successfully tested that even methods as simple as Gillespie Model can capture this non-monotonic 
relation between robustness and adaptability. Very shortly, I shall also add a pptx. to further explain the biology behind 
this. The results are crucial to direct the experimentalists to focus on the importance of the neutral mutations to create 
a diversity in the phenotypic neighborhood leading to improved adaptability of a species.
